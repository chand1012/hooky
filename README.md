# Hooky - configurable webhook Discord bot

Hooky is a bot that allows you to configure any webhook or REST request into a Discord command that can be triggered by users. It is designed to be easy to use and flexible, allowing you to configure any webhook or REST request you want.

## Why'd you make this?

I make a lot of projects. There's usually one thing those projects all have in common - a REST API. I wanted a way to quickly use my REST APIs from some sort of interface without having to write either a new Discord bot or a new web interface for each project. I also wanted to be able to configure these commands without having to write any code.

This means that in theory, if you just write a REST API, you can use Hooky to interact with it or even turn it into its own standalone Discord bot.

For example, something I use a lot is self-hosted no-code tools like [n8n](https://n8n.io) and [Dify](https://github.com/langgenius/dify). Both offer no-code options to interact with, however I wanted a single interface to interact with them, as well as any other REST interface. Hooky allows me to do that.
